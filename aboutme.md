My name is David Drysdale.

I am a researcher, strategist, and writer based in London, Ontario. 


### About this site

This is my blog. I write it mostly for myself. But, some of the things I write might be of interest or of use to others. I consider this as a place where I might "learn in public," or to share things and ideas that I think are neat.
